2. You'll be rendering the *example-1.qmd* file found in the *hw1* folder of this repository.  This contains an example

3. You'll be updating the *homework-1.qmd* file found in the *hw1* folder of this repository.  Instructions for updating the file can be found in the file itself.

4. Once updated, you'll need to *render* the *QMD* file to create *homework-1.html* file.
